The project is not what its name suggests, but an online food ordering app specifically designed as a Single Page Application with the aim of minimizing the loading time and giving a user-friendly and interactive experience which more often feels like a desktop application. Aims at providing uninterrupted services once loaded by minimizing requests to the server.  A single-page app can cache any local data effectively. It is built on the framework VueJS.
