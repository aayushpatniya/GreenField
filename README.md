The project is not what its name suggests, but an online food ordering app specifically designed as a Single Page Application with the aim of minimizing the loading time and giving a user-friendly and interactive experience which more often feels like a desktop application. Aims at providing uninterrupted services once loaded by minimizing requests to the server.  A single-page app can cache any local data effectively. An SPA sends only one request to a server and then stores all the data it receives. Then it can use this data and work even offline. If a user has poor connectivity, local data can be synchronized with the server when the connection allows.
